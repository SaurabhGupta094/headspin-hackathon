# Headspin Hackathon Challenge

## Overview
We as “Infostretch” team has built a Maven based Java project for Make My Trip mobile app automation hackathon challenge organized by the Headspin. Source code has some dependency on third party open source libraries like TestNG, Appium etc. and details are mentioned in "Dependencies" section.

## Team - Infostretch
* Mehul Kagathara (Lead)
* Amit Bhoraniya
* Nishith Shah
* Shivam Gohel

## Our Approach
As part of the implementation, we have tried to demonstrate the idea how we can abstract the technical implementation away from the operational components to support shift-left development and easy maintenance of automation project.
##### Below are key factors we kept in mind while solving given problem:
* **Structure Approach** - we have abstracted the technical implementation away from the operational components like configurations, locators & test data for easy maintenance.
* **Behaviour Driven Support** - we have integrated our solution with Cucumber for behaviour-driven test authoring make it easier to work together.
* **Unified Scripting Approach** - same scenario or test will work across the platform like Android, iOS & Web instead of writing separate test for each platform.
* **Reusable Test Assets** - highly maintainable and repeatable tests utilize reusable test assets, proper modularity and semantic structure.
* **Test Data Management** - test data's are also abstracted from the technical implementation so it is easier to update the data in future and avoid harding of data in implementation.
* **Reporting** - customized third party reporting engine which ensures access to all relevant test data which provide insights desired.
* **Scalability** - solution can be scalable on cloud like Headspin for Continous Testing and same is demonstrated in implementation.
